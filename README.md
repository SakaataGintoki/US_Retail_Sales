# Data Collection & Preparation
Source: 
Data was collected from Data.gov, the official open data platform of the U.S. government. It is a Real data provided by US Official
Specifically, retail and warehouse sales datasets related to suppliers, item categories, and sales values were used.

# Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power BI Power Query)
To ensure the dataset from data.gov was clean, reliable, and ready for analysis, I performed the following steps using Power BI’s Power Query Editor:

Changed Type – Assigned appropriate data types to columns (e.g., text, number, date).

Duplicated Column – Created a copy of a column for transformation or backup before modification.

Changed Type1 – Reassigned data types after transformation for consistency.

Removed Columns – Deleted unnecessary columns to reduce clutter and improve performance.

Removed Errors – Cleaned data by removing rows with errors (e.g., corrupt or unreadable data).

Replaced Value – Corrected inconsistent or missing values with standardized replacements.

Filtered Rows – Applied filters to remove irrelevant records or outliers.

Removed Errors1 & Removed Errors2 – Additional cleaning passes to ensure all errors were handled.

# Retail vs Warehouse Sales Trend
2019 is the peak year for both.
